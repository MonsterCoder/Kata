##13.6.1 Dog and Gopher

PC/UVa IDs: 111301/10310, Popularity: A, Success rate: average Level: 1
A large field has a dog and a gopher. The dog wants to eat the gopher, while the
gopher wants to run to safety through one of several gopher holes dug in the surface of
the field.
Neither the dog nor the gopher is a math major; however, neither is entirely stupid.
The gopher decides on a particular gopher hole and heads for that hole in a straight
line at a fixed speed. The dog, which is very good at reading body language, anticipates
which hole the gopher has chosen. The dog heads at double the speed of the gopher to
the hole. If the dog reaches the hole first, the gopher gets gobbled up; otherwise, the
gopher escapes.
You have been retained by the gopher to select a hole through which it can escape,
if such a hole exists.
Input
The input file contains several sets of input. The first line of each set contains one integer
and four floating point numbers. The integer n denotes how many holes are in the set.
The four floating point numbers denote the (x, y) coordinates of the gopher followed
by the (x, y) coordinates of the dog. The subsequent n lines of input each contain two
floating point numbers: the (x, y) coordinates of a gopher hole. All distances are in
meters to the nearest millimeter. The input is terminated by end of file and there is a
blank line between two consecutive sets.
Output
Print a single line for each set of input. If the gopher can escape, the output line should
read, "The gopher can escape through the hole at (x, y)." while identifying the
appropriate hole to the nearest millimeter. Otherwise, the output line should read, "The
gopher cannot escape." If the gopher can escape through more than one hole, report
the one that appears first in the input. There are at most 1,000 gopher holes in a set
of input and all coordinates range between â€“10,000 and +10,000.
Sample Input
1 1.000 1.000 2.000 2.000
1.500 1.500
2 2.000 2.000 1.000 1.000
1.500 1.500
2.500 2.500
Sample Output
The gopher cannot escape.
The gopher can escape through the hole at (2.500,2.500).
